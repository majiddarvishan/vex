# Audit handoff — 2026-11-10

**Repository:** `majiddarvishan/vex`
**Reviewed branch/commit:** `main` / `71e74d221f182f0567f43531f7f933104cb58c68`.
**Audit documentation branch:** `audit/codex-review-2026-11-10`.
**Scope:** static first-party C++/CMake/examples/tests review, production code unchanged.

## Completed
- Read repository metadata and recursive tracked tree; inspected first-party module headers/sources and test/example/CMake structure.
- Recorded code-backed issues with severity, paths/lines, impact, proposed fixes and regressions (`AUDIT.md`).
- Prepared agent instructions, architecture map, prioritized engineering backlog, reproducibility test matrix and focused scenarios.
- All changes in this branch are documentation only.

## Not completed / limitations
- **NOT RUN:** configuration, build, unit tests, CTest, sanitizer tests, code analysis tools, benchmark, end-to-end package consumer.
- Direct shell access to GitHub was unavailable due to DNS failure (`Could not resolve host: github.com`); connected GitHub source reads were used instead.
- Vendored CPM implementation and binary image not source-reviewed.
- Some hypothesized consequences (deadlock due to external macros, exact prometheus-cpp family conflict semantics, cross-device path behavior) require dynamic/contextual verification.
- No production behavior fix was made, and no claim of shipped reliability or full executable coverage is warranted.

## Recommended next change
Implement **WP01 (reproducible CMake/CTest and dependency boundaries)** on a new implementation branch; then **VEX-002** and **VEX-001**, followed by lifecycle metrics and threadpool. Do not optimize the lock-free queue before it is proven correct.

## Continuation prompt for an AI coding agent
```text
Open majiddarvishan/vex. Read root AGENTS.md and all .codex files. Rebase/compare audit baseline with HEAD. Build a reproducible CMake/CTest test harness first, preserving API compatibility. Turn critical audit findings VEX-001/002/003 into failing regression tests; fix them one issue at a time on reviewable branches, with ASan/UBSan/TSan runs. Do not claim tests without logs. Never merge or release automatically. Keep .codex/AUDIT.md and .codex/HANDOFF.md current with actual results and SHAs.
```
